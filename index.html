      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Dr. Eshan Singh — an energy and decarbonization expert with over a decade of experience working at the intersection of technology, industry, and research. I have led cross-disciplinary projects in carbon capture, hydrogen integration, renewable energy systems, and sustainable transportation across organizations like Pacific Gas & Electric, Meta Platforms, and Sandia National Laboratories.</p>
      <p>With a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and a portfolio spanning peer-reviewed publications, patents, and invited talks worldwide, I am passionate about driving innovative, scalable pathways toward a carbon-neutral future.</p>

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>My mission is to contribute meaningfully and realistically to the energy transition in our collective fight against climate change. I focus my efforts on addressing the major sources of emissions — tackling the critical sectors that have the greatest impact, rather than peripheral challenges. I believe that for innovation to matter, it must be realistic: technologies must have a credible path to deployment within our lifetimes, not decades into the future. To this end, I use mathematical and technological modeling to rigorously assess which solutions have true potential, and I regularly share these insights through my publications and thought leadership. My work is grounded in the belief that meaningful, near-term progress is possible when science, innovation, and pragmatism come together.</p>
